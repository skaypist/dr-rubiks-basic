# to run
`smaug run`

So you'll need to install dragonruby and smaug.

I don't remember exactly how I installed those, but until this section is updated, `Smaug.toml` may be of help.

Other the other details I can think of as far as development:
- Machine: Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015
- OS: MacOS Monterey 12.3.1
- DragonRuby Pro 3.13
- Smaug: 0.5.1

# Background (personal/project)

I did this mostly as practice. Can't commit to improvements but happy to discuss what's here.

# Thank You's

Thank you Amir Rajan, Ryan Gordon, and to the terrific community of DragonRiders.
