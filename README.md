# to run
`smaug run`

So you'll need to install dragonruby and smaug.

I don't remember exactly how I installed those, but until this section is updated, `Smaug.toml` may be of help.

Other the other details I can think of as far as development:
- Machine: Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015
- OS: MacOS Monterey 12.3.1
- DragonRuby Pro 3.13
- Smaug: 0.5.1

# Background (personal/project)

I did this mostly as a way to have some fun with Ruby, and as a bonus perhaps train my sense for (re)factoring and OOP.

When I started this, I don't think I was planning to build anything that would make up a rubiks cube. (I had tried something like that before this for a little, but I figured for this, I would just aim to get a single little cube to rotate/revolve or something like that.)

But once I got there, I thought it'd be more fun and a better exercise in refactoring to keep going and see how far I could take this along in the direction of a rubiks cube.

So basically this project is entirely selfish in motivation. And while I can't make any commitments to improvements, I'm definitely happy to discuss anything that's already here.

# Thank You's

Thank you Amir Rajan, Ryan Gordon, and to the terrific community of DragonRiders.
