**Addressed:**

quaternions instead of angle
  - pretty much done. still some messiness
no initials once we have quaternions
    - free rotation of the cube would kindof suck
    - we'd need to keep an initial there for it to not suck
        - or just keep calculating deltas, but that would probably suck as far as numerical drift
