touching cube face
    - we know the cubie faces have to have that characteristic
    - we know the cubies have to have that CubeFace characteristic on their faces

we want the layer that has that characteristic on their edge faces

z = 480


edge -> center



edge cubie face   -   y: 300
center cubie face -   y: 300


edge cubie
